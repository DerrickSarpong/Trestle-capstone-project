# Trestle-capstone-project
This is a capstone machine learning project for Trestle Academy's ML/AI internship.
It involves the creation of a machine-learning model that classifies brain tumors from MRI scans.
The model is able to predict between four classes: glioma, pituitary, meningioma an no tumor.
