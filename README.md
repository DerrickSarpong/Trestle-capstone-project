# Trestle-capstone-project
This is a capstone machine learning project for Trestle Academy's ML/AI internship.
It involves the creation of a machine-learning model that classifies brain tumors from MRI scans.
The model is able to predict between four classes: glioma, pituitary, meningioma, and no tumor.
The MRI dataset used for training and testing can for training and testing can be found on kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset![image](https://github.com/DerrickSarpong/Trestle-capstone-project/assets/68971642/73339b75-ff24-4f3d-a0cd-d8929d83a0ba)
